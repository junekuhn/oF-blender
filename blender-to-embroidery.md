# How to go from 3D model to embroidery

### Materials and Lighting

once you have the mesh imported to blender, the materials and lighting are basically the only thing that will be printed onto clothing.  Gradients are ok, because we're going to posterize them later in illustrator

### Position the Camera in Blender and Render

one of the trickier parts of learning blender is figuring out how to position the camera.  Remember g, r, s, and other shortcuts to move the camera, and use 0 on the numpad to see through the camera.  Do a render preview to see how the lighting is going to affect the object

### Image Tracing in Illustrator

This is probably one of the easier parts, but there's a few gotcha's

Window -> Image Trace 
Choose Color, 3-4 colors, adjust the advanced settings
once that's done, hit expand to actually get the vectors
clean it up a bit, the algorithm isn't perfect.
overlap is ok, the sewing machine can handle it.  
Make sure you have the colors and preview the colors to see how it's going to look
Save the illustrator file as legacy illustrator 3 or it won't load in the embroidery machine

### Upload to Embroidery Machine

hit 'graphics' mode in the software
import the illustrator image
hit convert, follow anna's steps from the hatchlabs website
make sure the hoop is the correct size.
Machine -> send to machine
make sure the order of the colors matches the color currently in the machine. I've already made the mistake of putting in the wrong color.
I hold the loose string in the back so that it doesn't get stitched into the fabric.

my 40 mm x 40 mm thing required about 2700 stitches and took about 25 minutes from when I started sewing to the end.
